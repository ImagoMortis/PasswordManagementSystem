This is a password management system that I programmed during my studies. It is my first Python project, by now I would probably manage it better.

--> You should not use it, because there are better and much more secure alternatives.
-->It was never developed with the intention to be used productively. It is a pure learning project

The password management system (PMS) uses Flask to provide an API.

authorizedUser.json:
- Contains the account data of the administrators

users.json:
- contains the account data of the users

policies.json:
- contains the password policies

main.py:
- contains the API interfaces

functions.py:
- contains the functions that bring the PMS to life

unittests.py:
- contains the unittests for some functions
